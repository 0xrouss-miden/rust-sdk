//! Account allowlist tests against a live node that enforces it.
//!
//! These tests need a node started with `MIDEN_ACCOUNT_ALLOWLIST=1`, which enforces the allowlist
//! and binds the administration API they create invitation codes through. Every other integration
//! test needs the opposite, because enforcement rejects the account creations they all do, so these
//! tests run in their own job against their own node and every other target filters them out. Run
//! them with `make integration-test-allowlist`.
//!
//! [`registration`] covers the `RegisterAccount` endpoint, and [`enforcement`] covers what the node
//! does with a submission once an account is registered or not. [`invitations`] creates the codes
//! both of them register with.
//!
//! What the node enforces, and therefore what these tests pin down:
//!
//! - Only account-creating submissions are checked. An account that already exists is not.
//! - Network accounts are exempt.
//! - An invitation code binds to one account and cannot be reused for another.
